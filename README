NoteEdit - a music score editor for Linux
http://noteedit.berlios.de
=========================================

Summary
-------
NoteEdit is a music score editor that supports an unlimited number of staffs,
an unlimited length of staffs, up to 9 voices per staff, a MIDI playback of
written notes, a number of import and export filters to many formats like MIDI,
MusicXML, ABC Music, PMX, MusiXTeX and LilyPond and more! 

Main features
-------------
* Insertion/deletion/modification of notes, rests (and multirests),
  ties/slurs, stem/beam control, instrument changes, repeats,
  clef/time/key/volume/tempo and all other classical music notation
  signatures.
* Chords markings (based on KGuitar project).
* Dynamic expression markings ((de)crescendo, octaviation, arpeggio, fermata,
  trills, grace notes etc.).
* Fixed expression markings (staccato, sforzato, portato, strong pizzicato,
  sforzando etc.).
* Multiple voices per staff (polyphony).
* Drum notes (including drum and bass drum clef).
* Flexible UI based on Qt/KDE. Supports zoom, multiple windows, many keyboard
  shortcuts, Konqueror embedding and other candies.
* Playback and other MIDI operations (reading and recording from MIDI keyboard)
  are done using TSE3 library. Each staff can have its own channel, own
  intsrument and own MIDI settings (reverbation, chorus). Currently played
  element is highlighted!
* Support for lyrics.
* Basic score layout operations (setting brackets, braces, continuing bars over
  staffs etc.).
* Many useful tools like automatic placment of bars, automatic placement of
  beams, transposition, copying&pasting of elements, optimization and resetting
  of accidentals, MIDI importing (or recording from MIDI keyboard) filters etc.
* Exports MIDI (using TSE3 library), MusicXML, ABC Music, PMX, MusiXTeX and
  LilyPond.
* Imports MIDI and MusicXML.
* The NoteEdit fileformat is similar to the format of the music publication
  program (MUP). It's a plaintext format, with a simple syntax for describing
  the music, so computer geeks can edit it by hand if they want to:).
* NoteEdit is translated into the following languages: German, Spanish, French,
  Hungarian, Italian, Russian, Slovak, Slovene and Swedish. It supports UTF-8
  encodings for lyrics, score title, composer, copyright and other document
  strings. 


The TSE3 library
----------------
From version 1.5.0 on, NoteEdit bases on a library by Pete Goodliffe called TSE3
(TSE3 Homepage). It is a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++.
The libkmid version is further supported but this version doesn't offer all
features (MIDI import for eg.).

TSE3 has its own file format and NoteEdit can produce it by means of TSE3
function calls. So the NoteEdit data are interchangable with sequencer
applications basing on TSE3.

The TSE3 library is not as much tested as the libkmid. So if you have problems
with MIDI playback, installation or other realated functions please contact Pete
Goodliffe. The TSE3 library comes with an application called tse3play. So you
can test whether it works on your system. If so NoteEdit should work too! 

Installation
------------
See INSTALL!

Konqueror embedding (experimental)
----------------------------------
You can configure the Konqueror browser such a way that it starts NoteEdit as an
embedded application. This requires installation of NoteEdit in KDE system.

To configure embedding, first search for a file noteedit.desktop in $HOME/.kde
(or $HOME/.kde2 or 3) and delete it!

Then start Konqueror and choose:

  Settings --> Configure Konqueror... --> File Associations -->
  Add... (Group) audio --> (Type name:) x-notes

In field Application Preference Order there should be already noteedit. In File
patterns: insert: *.not and *.not.sav

Press Apply and Ok! Now if you select a *.not and *.not.sav file the Konqueror
should show the NoteEdit program embedded in Konqueror surface. It should start
playing as well.

The TiMidity server
-------------------
(only with TSE3) Version 2.10.2 of the MIDI to WAVE converter and player
TiMidity++ now has a server mode. In this mode TiMidity++ behaves like a
hardware MIDI synthesizer. This approach is interesting for all those who can't
bring the MIDI device to work (mostly all non-SoundBlaster based cards).
TiMidity++ needs to be compiled with (at least) the configure options (most
Linux distributions already include these):

 --enable-audio=alsa --enable-server --enable-alsaseq

If so, you can start TiMidity++ with:

 timidity -iA -B8,2 -Os (if this doesn't work try -Od)

Make sure that NoteEdit uses an TSE3 ALSA MIDI scheduler! Select NoteEdit sound
configure dialog (Configure NoteEdit-->Sound). Make sure NoteEdit uses an ALSA
MIDI scheduler! You should see 2 new MIDI devices:
* Timidity port 0 128:0
* Timidity port 1 128:0

Choose one of them and the playback should work!

You should also try to change "the orchestra" by installing a different GUS
patch (or so called SoundFonts). Please look at the "Links" section at the
TiMidity++ page.

Tip: If the replay interrupts during turn over then start TiMidity++ as root.
This increases the priority of the TiMidity++ process.

NoteEdit has no special news group. You can find information about new
versions and features at (but do not uses these groups for bug reports, see Bug
reports):

Documentation
-------------
The documentation is part of the NoteEdit archive. You find it in the doc
directory. The german translation can be found under "de", the english original
is in the NoteEdit directory including all the pictures.

After having installed NoteEdit, you can read the documentation by selecting the
NoteEdit Handbook option from the Help menu.

In case of an error when trying to open the documentation file it might be that
KDE can't find it if you compiled the program from the sources. Try to change
the prefix so it points to the KDE directory on your distribution (usually /usr)
in that
case.
