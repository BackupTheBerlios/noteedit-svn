Todo list for the stable version 2.8.1. This file gets deleted in final version!
- The red off knob I expect at exit (Beenden), not at close
  (Schliessen).
- MusicXML import of hidden rests doesn't work as it should.
- Look at the current Lyrics code and make < > syntax working as described in
  Documentation. Also, add a few hints&tips into Lyrics dialog. (ThePianoGuy)
- Test the MusicXML arbitrary text import&export currently in trunk and merge it
  into stable. (ThePianoGuy)
- Add some critical checks in MusicXML import procedure, so no crashes occur if
  wrong values are stored in .xml file and maybe a wrong file format as well.
  Example: <divisions>0</divisions> crashes NoteEdit. Also, prevent importing
  some features that NoteEdit currently doesn't support yet, like cross-staff
  slurs. (ThePianoGuy)
- Add tool-tips to more buttons/options and add whatsThis to more widgets (when
  question cursor is selected from Window manager). This means a lot of new
  phrases for the translation as well. (ThePianoGuy)
- Improved Insert tempo dialog. (ThePianoGuy)
- When in Edit mode and walking through the music elements, each element should
  reflect its state in the toolbar. Currently, note lengths, punctuation,
  accidentals, slurs, ties and a few other signs work. What it doesn't work yet
  are the invisible rest button and grace notes. I'd also disable buttons like
  note length, arpeggio, fermata and others for non-musical signs like barlines,
  tempo signatures and arbitrary texts. I'd also separate strictly the options
  in Edit mode and the options in Insert mode. (ThePianoGuy)
- Escape key exits all the current modes and goes to selection mode (if in Edit
  mode, go to selection mode, if in Insert mode, select a mouse cursor to go to
  selection mode). (ThePianoGuy)
- MIDI instrument list should be a normal list (maybe without numbers) in order
  to activate automatic selection of instrument when hitting its capital on
  keyboard. (ThePianoGuy)
- Vertically lengthen end bar, repeat bar and other special bars, so they
connect staffs according to the document layout setting. (ThePianoGuy)
- Fix the ritardando/accellerando sometimes appearing MIDI playback bug (it eats
  notes or instead of slows down, speeds up). (ThePianoGuy)
- Fix for trills in non-C-major key signature (pitches sometimes not played
  right). (ThePianoGuy)
- Try to make Finale MusicXML <-> NoteEdit MusicXML work out of the box.
  currently when exporting from NE to Finale, Finale seems to find a
  non-MusicXML DTD's syntax on a test file I made (a Fugue, at around line 2400
  of a 30000 lines long .xml file). UPDATE: Finale's MusicXML import lite has a
  bit of problems chewing *ANY* MusicXML files. (ThePianoGuy)
- TRANSLATIONS!!!
- NoteEdit MIDI names not stored when exporting to MIDI. (Suamor)
- Scripting support. (Suamor, ThePianoGuy)
- Printing improvements. (Suamor)
- Improve the staff properties dialog 
- lilypond 2.6 (itsgeorg)
- faster scrolling (itsgeorg)
