			<h2>Documentation</h2>
				<h3>User manual</h3>
					<p>The documentation is part of the NoteEdit archive. You find it in the doc directory. 
					The german translation can be found under <b>"de"</b>, the english original is in the 
					NoteEdit directory including all the pictures.</p>
					<p>After having installed NoteEdit, you can read the documentation by selecting the 
					NoteEdit Handbook option from the Help menu.</p>
					<p>In case of an error when trying to open the documentation file it might be that KDE 
					can't find it if you compiled the program from the sources. Try to change the prefix so it 
					points to the KDE directory on your distribution (usually <b>/usr</b>) in that case.</p>

				<h3>The TSE3 library</h3>
					<p>From version 1.5.0 on, NoteEdit bases on a library by Pete Goodliffe called 
					<a href="http://tse3.sourceforge.net/">TSE3</a>. It is a powerful open source 
					sequencer engine written in C++. The libkmid version is further supported but this 
					version doesn't offer all features (MIDI import for example). </p>
					<p>TSE3 has its own file format and NoteEdit can produce it by means of TSE3 
					function calls. So the NoteEdit data are interchangable with sequencer applications 
					basing on TSE3. </p>
					<p>The TSE3 library is not as much tested as the libkmid. So if you have problems 
					with MIDI playback, installation or other realated functions please contact Pete 
					Goodliffe. The TSE3 library comes with an application called tse3play. So you can 
					test whether it works on your system. If so NoteEdit should work too! </p>
				
				<h3>Konqueror embedding (experimental)</h3>
					<p>You can configure the Konqueror browser such a way that it starts NoteEdit as 
					an embedded application. This requires installation of NoteEdit in KDE system.</p>
					<p>To configure embedding, first search for a file noteedit.desktop in $HOME/.kde 
					(or $HOME/.kde2 or 3) and delete it!</p>
					<p>Then start Konqueror and choose:</p>
					<p> Settings --&gt; Configure Konqueror... --&gt; File Associations --&gt;  Add... 
					(Group) audio --&gt; (Type name:) x-notes </p>
					<p>In field Application Preference Order there should be already noteedit. In File 
					patterns: insert: <b>*.not</b> and <b>*.not.sav</b> </p>
				
				<h3>The TiMidity server (only with TSE3)</h3>
					<p>Version 2.10.2 of the MIDI to WAVE converter and player 
					<a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">TiMidity++</a> now has a server mode. In 
					this mode TiMidity++ behaves like a hardware MIDI synthesizer. This approach is 
					interesting for all those who can't bring the MIDI device to work (mostly all 
					non-SoundBlaster based cards). TiMidity++ needs to be compiled with (at least) the 
					configure options (most Linux distributions already include these):</p>
					<pre> --enable-audio=alsa --enable-server --enable-alsaseq
</pre>
					<p>If so, you can start TiMidity++ with:</p>
					<pre> timidity -iA -B8,2 -Os (if this doesn't work try -Od)
</pre>
					<p>Make sure that NoteEdit uses an TSE3 ALSA MIDI scheduler! Select NoteEdit 
					sound configure dialog (Configure NoteEdit-->Sound). Make sure NoteEdit uses an ALSA 
					MIDI scheduler! You should see 2 new MIDI devices: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Timidity port 0 128:0</li>
						<li>Timidity port 1 128:0</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Choose one of them and the playback should work! </p>
					<p>You should also try to change "the orchestra" by installing a different GUS patch 
					(or so called SoundFonts). Please look at the "Links" section at the TiMidity++ page.</p>
					<p>Tip: If the replay interrupts during turn over then start TiMidity++ as root. This increases 
					the priority of the TiMidity++ process. </p>
