<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>User manual</h3>
<p>The documentation is part of the NoteEdit archive. You find it in
the doc directory. The german translation can be found under <b>"de"</b>,
the english original is in the NoteEdit directory including all the
pictures.</p>
<p>After having installed NoteEdit, you can read the documentation by
selecting the NoteEdit Handbook option from the Help menu.</p>
<p>In case of an error when trying to open the documentation file it
might be that KDE can't find it if you compiled the program from the
sources. Try to change the prefix so it points to the KDE directory on
your distribution (usually <b>/usr</b>) in that case.</p>
<p>The online documentation is <a href="doc/index.html">here</a>. A
PDF file can be downloaded <a href="doc/noteedit.pdf">here</a> (Use
your right mouse button on the link and select "download link").</p>
<h3>The TSE3 library</h3>
<p>From version 1.5.0 on, NoteEdit bases on a library by Pete Goodliffe
called <a href="http://tse3.sourceforge.net/">TSE3</a>. It is a
powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. The libkmid
version is further supported but this version doesn't offer all
features (MIDI import for example). </p>
<p>TSE3 has its own file format and NoteEdit can produce it by means of
TSE3 function calls. So the NoteEdit data are interchangable with
sequencer applications basing on TSE3. </p>
<p>The TSE3 library is not as much tested as the libkmid. So if you
have problems with MIDI playback, installation or other realated
functions please contact Pete Goodliffe. The TSE3 library comes with an
application called tse3play. So you can test whether it works on your
system. If so NoteEdit should work too! </p>
<h3>Konqueror embedding (experimental)</h3>
<p>You can configure the Konqueror browser such a way that it starts
NoteEdit as an embedded application. This requires installation of
NoteEdit in KDE system.</p>
<p>To configure embedding, first search for a file noteedit.desktop in
$HOME/.kde (or $HOME/.kde2 or 3) and delete it!</p>
<p>Then start Konqueror and choose:</p>
<p> Settings --&gt; Configure Konqueror... --&gt; File Associations
--&gt; Add... (Group) audio --&gt; (Type name:) x-notes </p>
<p>In field Application Preference Order there should be already
noteedit. In File patterns: insert: <b>*.not</b> and <b>*.not.sav</b>
</p>
<h3>The TiMidity server (only with TSE3)</h3>
<p>Version 2.10.2 of the MIDI to WAVE converter and player <a
 href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">TiMidity++</a> now has a
server mode. In this mode TiMidity++ behaves like a hardware MIDI
synthesizer. This approach is interesting for all those who can't bring
the MIDI device to work (mostly all non-SoundBlaster based cards).
TiMidity++ needs to be compiled with (at least) the configure options
(most Linux distributions already include these):</p>
<pre> --enable-audio=alsa --enable-server --enable-alsaseq<br></pre>
<p>If so, you can start TiMidity++ with:</p>
<pre> timidity -iA -B8,2 -Os (if this doesn't work try -Od)<br></pre>
<p>Make sure that NoteEdit uses an TSE3 ALSA MIDI scheduler! Select
NoteEdit sound configure dialog (Configure NoteEdit--&gt;Sound). Make
sure NoteEdit uses an ALSA MIDI scheduler! You should see 2 new MIDI
devices: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Timidity port 0 128:0</li>
  <li>Timidity port 1 128:0</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one of them and the playback should work! </p>
<p>You should also try to change "the orchestra" by installing a
different GUS patch (or so called SoundFonts). Please look at the
"Links" section at the TiMidity++ page.</p>
<p>Tip: If the replay interrupts during turn over then start TiMidity++
as root. This increases the priority of the TiMidity++ process. </p>
