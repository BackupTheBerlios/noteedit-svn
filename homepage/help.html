			<h2>We Need Your Help</h2>
			<p>If you're a composer, arranger or other musician who use NoteEdit, trust us your wishes, ideas and features you'd like to see them in future versions of NoteEdit, show us your own compositions, arrangements or other work you created and share your thoughts and vision of NoteEdit with us. If you're a programmer and would like to become a developer, join our mailing list and we'll gladly help you to get familiar with the code. If NoteEdit doesn't support your language yet or you would like to update the current translation, contact us and become a translator! NoteEdit also lacks the amount and quality of documentation in places. If you feel like updating or adding a paragraph or two to our documentation, we'll be grateful for your efforts. And if you think you could contribute to our project in any other way, feel free to join the mailing list and make a contact with us. Our goal is to make NoteEdit composer's best friend. We can achieve that only with *your* help!</p>
