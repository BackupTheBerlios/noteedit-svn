<h2>Features</h2>
<br>
   * Insertion/deletion/modification of notes, rests (and multirests),
     ties/slurs, stem/beam control, instrument changes, repeats,
     clef/time/key/volume/tempo and all other classical music notation
     signatures.
<br>
   * Chords markings (based on
     <a href="http://kguitar.sourceforge.net/">KGuitar project</a>).
<br>
   * Dynamic expression markings ((de)crescendo, octaviation, arpeggio, fermata,
     trills, grace notes etc.).
<br>
   * Fixed expression markings (staccato, sforzato, portato, strong pizzicato,
     sforzando etc.).
<br>
   * Multiple voices per staff (polyphony).
<br>
   * Drum notes (including drum and bass drum clef).
<br>
   * Flexible UI based on Qt/KDE. Supports zoom, multiple windows, many keyboard
     shortcuts, Konqueror embedding and other candies.
<br>
   * Playback and other MIDI operations (reading and recording from MIDI
     keyboard) are done using <a href="http://tse3.sourceforge.net/">TSE3
     library</a>. Each staff can have its own channel, own intsrument and own
     MIDI settings (reverbation, chorus). Currently played element is
     highlighted!
<br>
   * Support for lyrics.
<br>
   * Basic score layout operations (setting brackets, braces, continuing bars
     over staffs etc.).
<br>
   * Many useful tools like automatic placment of bars, automatic placement of
     beams, transposition, copying&pasting of elements, optimization and
     resetting of accidentals, MIDI importing (or recording from MIDI keyboard)
     filters etc.   
<br>
   * Exports MIDI (using TSE3 library), MusicXML, ABC Music, PMX, MusiXTeX and
     LilyPond.
<br>
   * Imports MIDI and MusicXML.
<br>
   * The NoteEdit fileformat is similar to the format of the music publication
     program (MUP). It's a plaintext format, with a simple syntax for describing
     the music, so computer geeks can edit it by hand if they want to:).
<br>
   * NoteEdit is translated into the following languages: German, Spanish,
     French, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, Slovak, Slovene and Swedish. It
     supports UTF-8 encodings for lyrics, score title, composer, copyright and
     other document strings.

<h2>The TSE3 library</h2>
<br>

From version 1.5.0 on, NoteEdit bases on a library by Pete Goodliffe
called TSE3 (<a href="http://TSE3.sourceforge.net">TSE3 Homepage<a>). It is
a powerful open source sequencer engine written in C++. The libkmid version
is further supported but this version doesn't offer all features (MIDI
import for eg.).
<br>
<br>
TSE3 has its own file format and NoteEdit can produce it by means of TSE3
function calls. So the NoteEdit data are interchangable with sequencer
applications basing on TSE3.
<br>
<br>
The TSE3 library is not as much tested as the libkmid. So if you have
problems with MIDI playback, installation or other realated functions please
contact Pete Goodliffe. The TSE3 library comes with an application called
tse3play. So you can test whether it works on your system. If so NoteEdit
should work too!
<br>
<h2>Konqueror embedding (experimental)</h2>
<br>
You can configure the Konqueror browser such a way that it starts NoteEdit
as an embedded application. This requires installation of NoteEdit in KDE
system.
<br>
<br>
To configure embedding, first search for a file noteedit.desktop in
$HOME/.kde (or $HOME/.kde2 or 3) and delete it!
<br>
<br>
Then start Konqueror and choose:
<br>
<br>
      Settings --> Configure Konqueror... --> File Associations -->
      Add...  (Group) audio --> (Type name:) x-notes
<br>
<br>
In field Application Preference Order there should be already noteedit. In
File patterns: insert: *.not and *.not.sav
<br>
<br>
Press Apply and Ok! Now if you select a *.not and *.not.sav file the
Konqueror should show the NoteEdit program embedded in Konqueror surface.
It should start playing as well.

<h2>The TiMidity server</h2>
<br>
(only with TSE3) Version 2.10.2 of the MIDI to WAVE converter and
player <a href="http://timidity.sourceforge.net/">TiMidity++</a> now has a
server mode. In this mode TiMidity++ behaves like a hardware MIDI
synthesizer. This approach is interesting for all those who can't bring the
MIDI device to work (mostly all non-SoundBlaster based cards). TiMidity++ needs
to be compiled with (at least) the configure options (most Linux distributions
already include these):
<br>
<br>
         --enable-audio=alsa --enable-server --enable-alsaseq
<br>
<br>
If so, you can start TiMidity++ with:
<br>
<br>
         timidity -iA -B8,2 -Os    (if this doesn't work try -Od)
<br>
<br>
Make sure that NoteEdit uses an TSE3 ALSA MIDI scheduler! Select NoteEdit
sound configure dialog (Configure NoteEdit-->Sound). Make sure NoteEdit
uses an ALSA MIDI scheduler! You should see 2 new MIDI devices:
<br>
   * Timidity port 0 128:0
<br>
   * Timidity port 1 128:0
<br>
<br>
Choose one of them and the playback should work!
<br>
<br>
You should also try to change "the orchestra" by installing a different GUS
patch (or so called SoundFonts). Please look at the "Links" section at the
TiMidity++ page.
<br>
<br>
Tip: If the replay interrupts during turn over then start TiMidity++ as
root. This increases the priority of the TiMidity++ process.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<br>
The documentation is part of the NoteEdit archive. You find
it in the doc directory. The german translation can be found
under "de", the english original is in the NoteEdit directory
including all the pictures.
<br>
<br>
After having installed NoteEdit, you can read the documentation
by selecting the NoteEdit Handbook option from the Help menu.
<br>
<br>
In case of an error when trying to open the documentation
file it might be that KDE can't find it if you compiled it from
the sources. Try to change the prefix so it points to the KDE 
directory on your distribution (usually /usr) in that case.
