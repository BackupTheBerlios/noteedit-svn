Release 2.8.0
-------------
The NoteEdit team is glad to announce the first major-version since its new
beginning!

Note:
From now on, NoteEdit will be versioned according to GNU principals of
versioning. Many SVN changes were made to accommodate these principals as well.
Where a version of the program is X.Y.Z, numbers now mean the following:
- Even subversion (Y) marks a stable branch of the application.
- Odd subversion (Y) marks a development branch of the application.
- Version number (X) is the current generation of the application.
- Minor version (Z) in a stable branch marks the latest critical maintainence
  release in that branch.
- Minor version (Z) in a development branch marks the current version of the
  latest stable enough SVN version of the application, to be called a useful
  development release.
