The files in this directory are partly modified portions of
the "kguitar" program version 0.4.1. As of this writing the whole programs
was available from:

    http://kguitar.sourceforge.net

I found the algorithms very surprising and I can't make it better.

The modifications mainly concern KDE3/Qt3 support.

I include the following files from original distribution:
